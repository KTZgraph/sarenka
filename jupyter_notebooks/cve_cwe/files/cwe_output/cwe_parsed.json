This can also occur between different character sets. For example, the Latin capital letter \"A\" and the Greek capital letter \"\u0391\" (Alpha) are treated as distinct by programs, but may be displayed in exactly the same way to a user. Accent marks may also cause letters to appear very similar, such as the Latin capital letter grave mark \"\u00c0\" and its equivalent \"\u00c1\" with the acute accent."

Therefore, the chipmaker must place a certain level of trust with the OSAT. To counter this, the chipmaker often requires the OSAT partner to enter into restrictive non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Nonetheless, OSAT vendors likely have many customers, which increases the risk of accidental sharing of information.

Few other on-chip fabrics and buses support security features and define specific interfaces/signals for transporting security attributes from master to slave or vice-versa.  However, including these signals is not mandatory and could be left unconfigured when generating the register-transfer-level (RTL) description for the fabric.  Such fabrics or buses should not be used to transport any security attribute coming from the bus master.

However, internally, two separate actions are performed: determining if the username exists, and checking if the password is correct.  If the product behaves differently based on whether the username exists or not, then the attacker only needs to concentrate on the password."

Attackers often perform \"fingerprinting,\" which uses discrepancies in order to identify which specific product is in use.  Once the specific product has been identified, the attacks can be made more customized and efficient.  Often, an organization might intentionally allow the specific product to be identifiable.  However, in some environments, the ability to identify a distinct product is unacceptable, and it is expected that every product would behave in exactly the same way.  In these more restricted environments, a behavioral difference might pose an unacceptable risk if it makes it easier to identify the product's vendor, model, configuration, version, etc."

        "extendedDescription": "When sensitive data such as a password or an encryption key is not removed from memory, it could be exposed to an attacker using a \"heap inspection\" attack that reads the sensitive data using memory dumps or other methods. The realloc() function is commonly used to increase the size of a block of allocated memory. This operation often requires copying the contents of the old memory block into a new and larger block. This operation leaves the contents of the original block intact but inaccessible to the program, preventing the program from being able to scrub sensitive data from memory. If an attacker can later examine the contents of a memory dump, the sensitive data could be exposed."

For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.
